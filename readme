Below is a detailed narrative of how the web application works from a user’s perspective:

---

### **User Journey & Workflow**

1. **Landing on the Homepage**  
   - **Overview:**  
     When a user first visits the site, they land on the homepage. Here, they see a brief overview of the Building Maintenance & Inspection System, its benefits, and a clear call-to-action to either **Log In** or **Register**.
   - **Navigation:**  
     The header displays links for Home, Login, and Register.

2. **User Registration or Login**  
   - **Registration Flow:**  
     - If the user is new, they click on **Register**.
     - They are presented with a form asking for details like name, email, password, and role (e.g., inspector or manager).
     - Once the form is submitted, the system creates a new account, and the user is prompted to log in.
   - **Login Flow:**  
     - If the user already has an account, they click on **Login**.
     - They enter their email and password.
     - Upon successful authentication, the user receives a token (stored in the browser for session persistence) and is redirected to the **Dashboard**.

3. **Accessing the Dashboard**  
   - **Dashboard Overview:**  
     Once logged in, the user is directed to the dashboard. This area is the control center for managing inspections.
   - **Dashboard Components:**  
     - **Header:** Displays the site name and navigation links such as Home, Dashboard, Profile, and a Logout button.
     - **Sidebar:** Provides quick navigation options like “Dashboard Home” and “Create Inspection.”
     - **Main Content Area:**  
       - The user sees a list of scheduled inspections with key details (facility ID, scheduled date, assigned inspector, etc.).
       - Each inspection is clickable, allowing the user to view further details.

4. **Viewing Inspection Details**  
   - **Inspection Detail Page:**  
     When a user clicks on an inspection from the dashboard:
     - They are taken to a detailed view page.
     - The page shows all relevant information about the inspection including:
       - **Facility Information:** Such as the facility ID.
       - **Scheduled Date & Time:** Clearly formatted for easy reading.
       - **Inspector Details:** Who is assigned to the inspection.
       - **Inspection Notes:** Any additional comments entered during scheduling.
     - **Issues Section:**  
       - Below the inspection details, there is a section listing any issues logged against that inspection.
       - Each issue includes a description and, if available, an image of the problem.
       
5. **Logging an Issue**  
   - **Issue Reporting:**  
     - If a problem is identified during an inspection, the user can log an issue directly from the inspection detail page.
     - They fill in a form that allows them to describe the problem and optionally upload a photo.
     - Upon submission, the issue is saved and added to the inspection’s issue list.
   
6. **Creating a New Inspection**  
   - **Inspection Creation:**  
     - From the dashboard sidebar, the user has an option to **Create Inspection**.
     - Clicking on this link opens a form where the user enters details like:
       - Facility ID
       - Scheduled Date and Time
       - Inspector (by entering the inspector’s identifier)
       - Additional Notes
     - After submitting the form, a new inspection record is created, and the user is automatically redirected to the newly created inspection’s detail page for further actions (such as logging issues or generating a report).

7. **Generating a Compliance Report**  
   - **Report Generation Process:**  
     - On the inspection detail page, a **Generate Report** button is available.
     - When the user clicks this button:
       - The system communicates with the backend to generate a PDF compliance report that includes:
         - All details of the inspection.
         - A list of any logged issues (with descriptions and image URLs if provided).
       - Once the report is generated, it is automatically downloaded to the user’s device.
   
8. **Managing User Profile**  
   - **Profile Page:**  
     - The header includes a **Profile** link.
     - When accessed, the profile page displays the user’s information such as name, email, and role.
     - The user can review or update their details if needed.

9. **Logout**  
   - **Ending the Session:**  
     - When the user clicks the **Logout** button in the header:
       - The system clears the stored authentication token.
       - The user is redirected back to the login page, ending their session securely.
